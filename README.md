# Lending Club Case Study

## Problem Statement:
Lending Club is a financing company that funds loans for a varied type of purposes for a
wide range of audience in most of the US regions.
Analyze LC borrowers behavior i.e. if the applicant is likely to repay the loan,
then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company OR if the
applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then
approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Objective:
We have a dataset with details of borrowers and their loan attributes which can be used to
draw few observations on the who charged off (unable to repay)
What are the factors which might affect them being defaulted.
This enables LC to make certain decisions and being more cautious while evaluating the
applicant’s profile when they apply for a loan.

## Observations:
DTI should be considered while issuing loan.
Annual income plays a role to determine capability of borrower’s loan repayment.
Interest rates can be as low as possible to avoid borrowers being defaulted.
Lending club might need to be cautious while issuing loans towards calendar year end.
Location-wise verification can be sorted to make decision while sanctioning loans.
Verification process must be improved.
