# Lending Club Case Study

## Problem Statement:
Lending Club is a financing company that funds loans for a varied type of purposes for a <br>
wide range of audience in most of the US regions. <br>
Analyze LC borrowers behavior i.e. if the applicant is likely to repay the loan, <br>
then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company OR if the <br>
applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then <br>
approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company <br>

## Objective:
We have a dataset with details of borrowers and their loan attributes which can be used to <br>
draw few observations on the who charged off (unable to repay). <br>
What are the factors which might affect them being defaulted. <br>
This enables LC to make certain decisions and being more cautious while evaluating the <br>
applicant’s profile when they apply for a loan. <br>

## Observations:
DTI should be considered while issuing loan. <br>
Annual income plays a role to determine capability of borrower’s loan repayment. <br>
Interest rates can be as low as possible to avoid borrowers being defaulted. <br>
Lending club might need to be cautious while issuing loans towards calendar year end. <br>
Location-wise verification can be sorted to make decision while sanctioning loans. <br>
Verification process must be improved. <br>
